# Estimating school-age populations exposed to risks

This [methodological paper](https://www.internal-displacement.org/sites/default/files/UNESCO-IIEP-Background-paper-GRID-2022-GAGNON-&-VARGAS-MESA.pdf) (https://at.iiep.unesco.org/2022-GRIDbg) presents a way of estimating the school age population exposed to natural risks, such as floods, by combining satellite-detected natural events' extents with spatialized population estimates, and applying the Sprague multipliers to obtain reconstructed school age groups, for any area in the world. It was presented as a background paper for the [2022 GRID Report](https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2022/) by IDMC, and has particular applications for emergency and humanitarian responses. 

This paper uses the methodology developed by [Gagnon & Vargas Mesa (2021)](https://at.iiep.unesco.org/SSAP), with the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/iiepdev/Spatialized-school-age-populations), and the [QGIS plugin](https://github.com/iiepdev/SSAP-QGIS-plugin). It then combines the generated spatialized school-age populations with [UNOSAT emergency mapping analyses](https://unosat.org/products), created in response to humanitarian emergencies related to disasters, complex emergencies and conflict situations
